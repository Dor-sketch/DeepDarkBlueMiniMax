## 📚 Background

A game tree is a structure resembling a tree, used to illustrate the potential moves and outcomes in a game. However, its practicality is limited due to the exponential growth of nodes in relation to the tree's depth. For instance, in a game with merely two options per move and a tree depth of 10, we would end up with $2^{10} = 1024$ nodes. In more intricate games, such as chess, the number of nodes can escalate to $10^{120}$, surpassing the total number of atoms in the universe.

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making tool used to determine the best move for a player in a game. It represents an enhancement over the brute force algorithm, which assesses all potential moves and their results. The premise is that for certain games, we can forecast the game's outcome if both players employ optimal strategies, without the need to evaluate every possible move. For instance, consider the following board configuration in a game of Tic Tac Toe:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
  &   &  X\\
O &  & \\
X & O & X
\end{array}\right)
$$

Regardless of the move 'O' makes, 'X' can secure a win. Give it a try! This is why we can cease evaluating the game tree once we identify moves that the opposing player can execute, leading to our defeat.

The minimax algorithm operates by recursively evaluating the game tree. It commences at the tree's root and continues to expand the tree until it reaches a terminal (leaf) node. For instance:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
  &   & [X]\\
O & [X] & O\\
[X] & O & X
\end{array}\right)
$$

This is a terminal node since 'X' can secure a win. The algorithm evaluates the utility of this node and relays it back to the parent node. Subsequently, the parent node assesses the utility of its child nodes. Here's where it gets interesting - let's assume the parent node represents the first player (max node) and the child nodes represent the second player (min nodes). Contrary to what you might expect, the algorithm selects the minimum utility from the child nodes: the max node chooses the maximum of the minimums, and the min node selects the minimum of the maximums. This counterintuitive approach is why it's called the minimax algorithm. Personally, I find it helpful to consider it as the player's least detrimental option.

The algorithm then backtracks the utility of the child nodes to the parent node, all the way up to the root node, which can then determine the optimal move for the player. The following diagram illustrates the game trees for the Stone Taking Game and Tic Tac Toe, showcasing the minimax decision-making process.

The minimax algorithm is a powerful tool for decision-making in games, but it has its limitations. The game tree's exponential growth can lead to an impractical number of nodes, rendering the algorithm inefficient. This is where alpha-beta pruning comes into play. It is a technique used to reduce the number of nodes evaluated by the minimax algorithm, enhancing its efficiency. The algorithm employs a cutoff mechanism, which ceases the evaluation of nodes that are no longer relevant to the decision-making process. This is achieved by maintaining two values, alpha and beta, which represent the best value for the max and min nodes, respectively. The algorithm then compares the utility of the nodes to these values, and if the utility exceeds the alpha or beta value, the node is pruned. The following diagram illustrates the alpha-beta pruning process, showcasing the nodes that are pruned from the game tree.

This program employs the principles of the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning, applicable to any game type. The game logic is entirely encapsulated within the `GameLogic` class, serving as a foundational class for games. It can be adapted for use in any other game. The `StoneGame` and `TicTacToe` classes serve as examples, demonstrating how to utilize the `GameLogic` class.

```python
# part of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning - from the Minimax class
    def min_value(self, state: List[int], alpha: int, beta: int, depth: int, iterations: int = 10) -> (int, int):
        """
        Returns the minimum value and the action that leads to that value
        """
        v = inf
        best_move = None
        if self.game.is_terminal(state, MIN):
            v = self.game.utility(state, MIN)
        else:
            for a in self.game.actions(state):
                new_state = self.game.result(state, a)
                v2, a2 = self.max_value(
                    new_state, alpha, beta, depth + 1, iterations-1)
                if v2 < v:
                    best_move = a
                    v = v2
                beta = min(beta, v2)
                if v <= alpha:
                    break
        return v, best_move
```

## 🎮 Example Games

Each game utilizes a the `Game` class, which is a base class for the games. It contains the transition function, which is used to generate the next state of the game, and the utility function, which is used to evaluate the game state. The `StoneGame` and `TicTacToe` classes inherit from the `Game` class and implement their own transition and utility functions.

### 🪨 Stone Taking Game

**Note**: This game is currently not work with the latest version of the minimax algorithm, it will be updated soon.

The game was initially introduced as a `Hard` problem on LeetCode <https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iii/>. While this implementation doesn't apply to the LeetCode problem, it remains an entertaining game to engage in. Its primary objective is to illustrate the minimax algorithm, providing an interactive platform for players. Additionally, it offers insights into the game's decision-making process and the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.

Specific to the Stone Taking Game, the Algorithm implementation uses the different between the player and the computer scores as the utility of the game. This lead to the first player (max node) to try to maximize the utility of the game, and the second player (min node) to try to minimize the utility of the game , wich is equivalent to maximize his own utility (less for player 1 mean more for player 2).

Included Features:

- **Player vs. Computer Gameplay**: Take turns with the computer to remove 1-3 stones from the pile.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The computer calculates its moves using the minimax algorithm, ensuring a challenging game.
- **GUI Interaction**: The game uses Tkinter for the GUI, making it interactive and user-friendly.
- **Visualization**: Utilizes NetworkX for visualizing the minimax strategy tree, offering insight into the game's decision-making process.
